# Data_Analysis
This repository contains the **R code** for an exercise of the *Data Analysis* course at my university.

The code focuses on analyzing the relationship between house prices and the number of bathrooms using:
- Correlation analysis
- Linear regression modeling
- Log-transformed regression
- Assumption testing (normality, homoscedasticity)
- Outlier detection

The exercise includes both interpretation and visualization of results in R.
